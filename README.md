# Shopping List App

This app is a shopping list that will allow the users to add items to the list, it will then allow the user to check and uncheck the boxes.

I decided to create this app because it was a good way to learn how to dynamically create a check list and add items from a edit field into a hash map and show a list.

## Development Environment
* Android Studios

The language that I used for this is Java, I used this because I did a Java sprint for my first sprint
and so I know java going into it. I used the widget library because it has the buttons, and I used
the view library to be able to use the event listener.
